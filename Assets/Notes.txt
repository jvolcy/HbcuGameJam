An evil blimp is hovering over the skies at the AUC and shooting down
anti-creativity rays in an attempt to ruin the HBCU Game Jam.
Your mission is to destroy the blimp and save the hackathon.
To do this, you must first take down the 11 shields that protect the blimp.
Each shield is temporarily disabled when hit.  When all shields are down,
the blimp is vulnerable to attack.  This is your chance to destroy it and
save the day!  Beware, the blimp is defended by a fleet of planes ready to
repel any attackers.  Good luck!
